# Overview of Community Zoho Calendar n8n Node
I created this node because an organization I am affiliated with uses Zoho software and I would like to make it easier for our users to automate with n8n.  \
Also, many of my clients use Zoho products, so making a suit of Zoho nodes will help get them aboard the n8n train! Choo chooooo ðŸš‚


I will focus more on the documentation and readme after I am finished making the functionality of the actual node.

# If you want a custom node
Please reach out to me using the info on [my GitHub page](https://github.com/liamdmcgarrigle).  \
Nodes can be built for the community as well as privately just for one organization.

# Documentation

## How to install
Currently, this node is under development and only possible to run in a development environment.

I will update this when it is published on npm and ready to use!

## Create a New Credential in n8n 

1. Go to create a new credential in n8n
It is named "Zoho Calendar OAuth2 API"

2. Set up your Zoho OAuth Client
   
Go [here](https://api-console.zoho.com/) and create a "Server-based Application"  \
In the homepage url field add your n8n instances url.

In the Authorized Redirect URIs field, add the redirect URI from the n8n credential page as well as `https://calendar.zoho.com/`

Then press the "Create" button

3. Copy and Paste your client and secret ID into n8n's credential page
   
4. Press the Connect My Account button and agree to the popup
